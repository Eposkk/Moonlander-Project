# Moonlander-Project
Final assignment in the High School Subject Programmering og Modellering.

This repository contains a game where the goal is to land a spaceship on the moon

The game simulates fuel flow, weight and gravity. You can land it yourself or choose to watch the computer perform a perfect landing

Each time you launch the game, the starting parameters are randomized.

NOTE: This project was written as the final assignment in the first programming course i ever took. There are therefore a number of issues with this project
